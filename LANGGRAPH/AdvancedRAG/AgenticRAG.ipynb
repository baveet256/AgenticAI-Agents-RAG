AgentRelease policySecurity PolicyTutorialsBuild a simple LLM application with chat models and prompt templatesOn this pageBuild a simple LLM application with chat models and prompt templates\\nIn this quickstart we\\'ll show you how to build a simple LLM application with LangChain. This application will translate text from English into another language. This is a relatively simple LLM application - it\\'s just a single LLM call plus some prompting. Still, this is a great way to get started with LangChain - a lot of features can be built with just some prompting and an LLM call!\\nAfter reading this tutorial, you\\'ll have a high level overview of:\\n\\n\\nUsing language models\\n\\n\\nUsing prompt templates\\n\\n\\nDebugging and tracing your application using LangSmith\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s dive in!\\nSetup\\u200b\\nJupyter Notebook\\u200b\\nThis and other tutorials are perhaps most conveniently run in a Jupyter notebooks. Going through guides in an interactive environment is a great way to better understand them. See here for instructions on how to install.\\nInstallation\\u200b\\nTo install LangChain run:\\n\\nPipCondapip install langchainconda install langchain -c conda-forge\\nFor more details, see our Installation guide.\\nLangSmith\\u200b\\nMany of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls.\\nAs these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent.\\nThe best way to do this is with LangSmith.\\nAfter you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:\\nexport LANGSMITH_TRACING=\"true\"export LANGSMITH_API_KEY=\"...\"export LANGSMITH_PROJECT=\"default\" # or any other project name\\nOr, if in a notebook, you can set them with:\\nimport getpassimport ostry:    # load environment variables from .env file (requires `python-dotenv`)    from dotenv import load_dotenv    load_dotenv()except ImportError:    passos.environ[\"LANGSMITH_TRACING\"] = \"true\"if \"LANGSMITH_API_KEY\" not in os.environ:    os.environ[\"LANGSMITH_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass(        prompt=\"Enter your LangSmith API key (optional): \"    )if \"LANGSMITH_PROJECT\" not in os.environ:    os.environ[\"LANGSMITH_PROJECT\"] = getpass.getpass(        prompt=\\'Enter your LangSmith Project Name (default = \"default\"): \\'    )    if not os.environ.get(\"LANGSMITH_PROJECT\"):        os.environ[\"LANGSMITH_PROJECT\"] = \"default\"\\nUsing Language Models\\u200b\\nFirst up, let\\'s learn how to use a language model by itself. LangChain supports many different language models that you can use interchangeably. For details on getting started with a specific model, refer to supported integrations.\\n\\n\\n\\nSelect chat model:Google Gemini‚ñæOpenAIAnthropicAzureGoogle GeminiGoogle VertexAWSGroqCohereNVIDIAFireworks AIMistral AITogether AIIBM watsonxDatabricksxAIPerplexitypip install -qU \"langchain[google-genai]\"import getpassimport osif not os.environ.get(\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\"):  os.environ[\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass(\"Enter API key for Google Gemini: \")from langchain.chat_models import init_chat_modelmodel = init_chat_model(\"gemini-2.5-flash\", model_provider=\"google_genai\")\\nLet\\'s first use the model directly. ChatModels are instances of LangChain Runnables, which means they expose a standard interface for interacting with them. To simply call the model, we can pass in a list of messages to the .invoke method.\\nfrom langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, SystemMessagemessages = [    SystemMessage(\"Translate the following from English into Italian\"),    HumanMessage(\"hi!\"),]model.invoke(messages)API Reference:HumanMessage | SystemMessage\\nAIMessage(content=\\'Ciao!\\', additional_kwargs={\\'refusal\\': None}, response_metadata={\\'token_usage\\': {\\'completion_tokens\\': 3, \\'prompt_tokens\\': 20, \\'total_tokens\\': 23, \\'completion_tokens_details\\': {\\'accepted_prediction_tokens\\': 0, \\'audio_tokens\\': 0, \\'reasoning_tokens\\': 0, \\'rejected_prediction_tokens\\': 0}, \\'prompt_tokens_details\\': {\\'audio_tokens\\': 0, \\'cached_tokens\\': 0}}, \\'model_name\\': \\'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\\', \\'system_fingerprint\\': \\'fp_0705bf87c0\\', \\'finish_reason\\': \\'stop\\', \\'logprobs\\': None}, id=\\'run-32654a56-627c-40e1-a141-ad9350bbfd3e-0\\', usage_metadata={\\'input_tokens\\': 20, \\'output_tokens\\': 3, \\'total_tokens\\': 23, \\'input_token_details\\': {\\'audio\\': 0, \\'cache_read\\': 0}, \\'output_token_details\\': {\\'audio\\': 0, \\'reasoning\\': 0}})\\ntipIf we\\'ve enabled LangSmith, we can see that this run is logged to LangSmith, and can see the LangSmith trace. The LangSmith trace reports token usage information, latency, standard model parameters (such as temperature), and other information.\\nNote that ChatModels receive message objects as input and generate message objects as output. In addition to text content, message objects convey conversational roles and hold important data, such as tool calls and token usage counts.\\nLangChain also supports chat model inputs via strings or OpenAI format. The following are equivalent:\\nmodel.invoke(\"Hello\")model.invoke([{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello\"}])model.invoke([HumanMessage(\"Hello\")])\\nStreaming\\u200b\\nBecause chat models are Runnables, they expose a standard interface that includes async and streaming modes of invocation. This allows us to stream individual tokens from a chat model:\\nfor token in model.stream(messages):    print(token.content, end=\"|\")\\n|C|iao|!||\\nYou can find more details on streaming chat model outputs in this guide.\\nPrompt Templates\\u200b\\nRight now we are passing a list of messages directly into the language model. Where does this list of messages come from? Usually, it is constructed from a combination of user input and application logic. This application logic usually takes the raw user input and transforms it into a list of messages ready to pass to the language model. Common transformations include adding a system message or formatting a template with the user input.\\nPrompt templates are a concept in LangChain designed to assist with this transformation. They take in raw user input and return data (a prompt) that is ready to pass into a language model.\\nLet\\'s create a prompt template here. It will take in two user variables:\\n\\nlanguage: The language to translate text into\\ntext: The text to translate\\n\\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplatesystem_template = \"Translate the following from English into {language}\"prompt_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(    [(\"system\", system_template), (\"user\", \"{text}\")])API Reference:ChatPromptTemplate\\nNote that ChatPromptTemplate supports multiple message roles in a single template. We format the language parameter into the system message, and the user text into a user message.\\nThe input to this prompt template is a dictionary. We can play around with this prompt template by itself to see what it does by itself\\nprompt = prompt_template.invoke({\"language\": \"Italian\", \"text\": \"hi!\"})prompt\\nChatPromptValue(messages=[SystemMessage(content=\\'Translate the following from English into Italian\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}), HumanMessage(content=\\'hi!\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})])\\nWe can see that it returns a ChatPromptValue that consists of two messages. If we want to access the messages directly we do:\\nprompt.to_messages()\\n[SystemMessage(content=\\'Translate the following from English into Italian\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}), HumanMessage(content=\\'hi!\\', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})]\\nFinally, we can invoke the chat model on the formatted prompt:\\nresponse = model.invoke(prompt)print(response.content)\\nCiao!\\ntipMessage content can contain both text and content blocks with additional structure. See this guide for more information.\\nIf we take a look at the LangSmith trace, we can see exactly what prompt the chat model receives, along with token usage information, latency, standard model parameters (such as temperature), and other information.\\nConclusion\\u200b\\nThat\\'s it!

AgentRelease policySecurity PolicyConceptual guideChat modelsOn this pageChat models\\nOverview\\u200b\\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are advanced machine learning models that excel in a wide range of language-related tasks such as text generation, translation, summarization, question answering, and more, without needing task-specific fine tuning for every scenario.\\nModern LLMs are typically accessed through a chat model interface that takes a list of messages as input and returns a message as output.\\nThe newest generation of chat models offer additional capabilities:\\n\\nTool calling: Many popular chat models offer a native tool calling API. This API allows developers to build rich applications that enable LLMs to interact with external services, APIs, and databases. Tool calling can also be used to extract structured information from unstructured data and perform various other tasks.\\nStructured output: A technique to make a chat model respond in a structured format, such as JSON that matches a given schema.\\nMultimodality: The ability to work with data other than text; for example, images, audio, and video.\\n\\nFeatures\\u200b\\nLangChain provides a consistent interface for working with chat models from different providers while offering additional features for monitoring, debugging, and optimizing the performance of applications that use LLMs.\\n\\nIntegrations with many chat model providers (e.g., Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama, Microsoft Azure, Google Vertex, Amazon Bedrock, Hugging Face, Cohere, Groq). Please see chat model integrations for an up-to-date list of supported models.\\nUse either LangChain\\'s messages format or OpenAI format.\\nStandard tool calling API: standard interface for binding tools to models, accessing tool call requests made by models, and sending tool results back to the model.\\nStandard API for structuring outputs via the with_structured_output method.\\nProvides support for async programming, efficient batching, a rich streaming API.\\nIntegration with LangSmith for monitoring and debugging production-grade applications based on LLMs.\\nAdditional features like standardized token usage, rate limiting, caching and more.\\n\\nIntegrations\\u200b\\nLangChain has many chat model integrations that allow you to use a wide variety of models from different providers.\\nThese integrations are one of two types:\\n\\nOfficial models: These are models that are officially supported by LangChain and/or model provider. You can find these models in the langchain-<provider> packages.\\nCommunity models: There are models that are mostly contributed and supported by the community. You can find these models in the langchain-community package.\\n\\nLangChain chat models are named with a convention that prefixes \"Chat\" to their class names (e.g., ChatOllama, ChatAnthropic, ChatOpenAI, etc.).\\nPlease review the chat model integrations for a list of supported models.\\nnoteModels that do not include the prefix \"Chat\" in their name or include \"LLM\" as a suffix in their name typically refer to older models that do not follow the chat model interface and instead use an interface that takes a string as input and returns a string as output.\\nInterface\\u200b\\nLangChain chat models implement the BaseChatModel interface. Because BaseChatModel also implements the Runnable Interface, chat models support a standard streaming interface, async programming, optimized batching, and more. Please see the Runnable Interface for more details.\\nMany of the key methods of chat models operate on messages as input and return messages as output.\\nChat models offer a standard set of parameters that can be used to configure the model. These parameters are typically used to control the behavior of the model, such as the temperature of the output, the maximum number of tokens in the response, and the maximum time to wait for a response. Please see the standard parameters section for more details.\\nnoteIn documentation, we will often use the terms \"LLM\" and \"Chat Model\" interchangeably. This is because most modern LLMs are exposed to users via a chat model interface.However, LangChain also has implementations of older LLMs that do not follow the chat model interface and instead use an interface that takes a string as input and returns a string as output. These models are typically named without the \"Chat\" prefix (e.g., Ollama, Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.).\\nThese models implement the BaseLLM interface and may be named with the \"LLM\" suffix (e.g., OllamaLLM, AnthropicLLM, OpenAILLM, etc.). Generally, users should not use these models.\\nKey methods\\u200b\\nThe key methods of a chat model are:\\n\\ninvoke: The primary method for interacting with a chat model. It takes a list of messages as input and returns a list of messages as output.\\nstream: A method that allows you to stream the output of a chat model as it is generated.\\nbatch: A method that allows you to batch multiple requests to a chat model together for more efficient processing.\\nbind_tools: A method that allows you to bind a tool to a chat model for use in the model\\'s execution context.\\nwith_structured_output: A wrapper around the invoke method for models that natively support structured output.\\n\\nOther important methods can be found in the BaseChatModel API Reference.\\nInputs and outputs\\u200b\\nModern LLMs are typically accessed through a chat model interface that takes messages as input and returns messages as output. Messages are typically associated with a role (e.g., \"system\", \"human\", \"assistant\") and one or more content blocks that contain text or potentially multimodal data (e.g., images, audio, video).\\nLangChain supports two message formats to interact with chat models:\\n\\nLangChain Message Format: LangChain\\'s own message format, which is used by default and is used internally by LangChain.\\nOpenAI\\'s Message Format: OpenAI\\'s message format.\\n\\nStandard parameters\\u200b\\nMany chat models have standardized parameters that can be used to configure the model:\\nParameterDescriptionmodelThe name or identifier of the specific AI model you want to use (e.g., \"gpt-3.5-turbo\" or \"gpt-4\").temperatureControls the randomness of the model\\'s output. A higher value (e.g., 1.0) makes responses more creative, while a lower value (e.g., 0.0) makes them more deterministic and focused.timeoutThe maximum time (in seconds) to wait for a response from the model before canceling the request. Ensures the request doesn‚Äôt hang indefinitely.max_tokensLimits the total number of tokens (words and punctuation) in the response. This controls how long the output can be.stopSpecifies stop sequences that indicate when the model should stop generating tokens. For example, you might use specific strings to signal the end of a response.max_retriesThe maximum number of attempts the system will make to resend a request if it fails due to issues like network timeouts or rate limits.api_keyThe API key required for authenticating with the model provider. This is usually issued when you sign up for access to the model.base_urlThe URL of the API endpoint where requests are sent. This is typically provided by the model\\'s provider and is necessary for directing your requests.rate_limiterAn optional BaseRateLimiter to space out requests to avoid exceeding rate limits.  See rate-limiting below for more details.\\nSome important things to note:\\n\\nStandard parameters only apply to model providers that expose parameters with the intended functionality. For example, some providers do not expose a configuration for maximum output tokens, so max_tokens can\\'t be supported on these.\\nStandard parameters are currently only enforced on integrations that have their own integration packages (e.g. langchain-openai, langchain-anthropic, etc.), they\\'re not enforced on models in langchain-community.\\n\\nChat models also accept other parameters that are specific to that integration. To find all the parameters supported by a Chat model head to the their respective API reference for that model.\\nTool calling\\u200b\\nChat models can call tools to perform tasks such as fetching data from a database, making API requests, or running custom code. Please\\nsee the tool calling guide for more information.\\nStructured outputs\\u200b\\nChat models can be requested to respond in a particular format (e.g., JSON or matching a particular schema). This feature is extremely\\nuseful for information extraction tasks. Please read more about\\nthe technique in the structured outputs guide.\\nMultimodality\\u200b\\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) are not limited to processing text. They can also be used to process other types of data, such as images, audio, and video. This is known as multimodality.\\nCurrently, only some LLMs support multimodal inputs, and almost none support multimodal outputs. Please consult the specific model documentation for details.\\nContext window\\u200b\\nA chat model\\'s context window refers to the maximum size of the input sequence the model can process at one time. While the context windows of modern LLMs are quite large, they still present a limitation that developers must keep in mind when working with chat models.\\nIf the input exceeds the context window, the model may not be able to process the entire input and could raise an error. In conversational applications, this is especially important because the context window determines how much information the model can \"remember\" throughout a conversation. Developers often need to manage the input within the context window to maintain a coherent dialogue without exceeding the limit. For more details on handling memory in conversations, refer to the memory.\\nThe size of the input is measured in tokens which are the unit of processing that the model uses.\\nAdvanced topics\\u200b\\nRate-limiting\\u200b\\nMany chat model providers impose a limit on the number of requests that can be made in a given time period.\\nIf you hit a rate limit, you will typically receive a rate limit error response from the provider, and will need to wait before making more requests.\\nYou have a few options to deal with rate limits:\\n\\nTry to avoid hitting rate limits by spacing out requests: Chat models accept a rate_limiter parameter that can be provided during initialization. This parameter is used to control the rate at which requests are made to the model provider. Spacing out the requests to a given model is a particularly useful strategy when benchmarking models to evaluate their performance. Please see the how to handle rate limits for more information on how to use this feature.\\nTry to recover from rate limit errors: If you receive a rate limit error, you can wait a certain amount of time before retrying the request. The amount of time to wait can be increased with each subsequent rate limit error. Chat models have a max_retries parameter that can be used to control the number of retries. See the standard parameters section for more information.\\nFallback to another chat model: If you hit a rate limit with one chat model, you can switch to another chat model that is not rate-limited.\\n\\nCaching\\u200b\\nChat model APIs can be slow, so a natural question is whether to cache the results of previous conversations. Theoretically, caching can help improve performance by reducing the number of requests made to the model provider. In practice, caching chat model responses is a complex problem and should be approached with caution.\\nThe reason is that getting a cache hit is unlikely after the first or second interaction in a conversation if relying on caching the exact inputs into the model. For example, how likely do you think that multiple conversations start with the exact same message? What about the exact same three messages?\\nAn alternative approach is to use semantic caching, where you cache responses based on the meaning of the input rather than the exact input itself. This can be effective in some situations, but not in others.\\nA semantic cache introduces a dependency on another model on the critical path of your application (e.g., the semantic cache may rely on an embedding model to convert text to a vector representation), and it\\'s not guaranteed to capture the meaning of the input accurately.\\nHowever, there might be situations where caching chat model responses is beneficial. For example, if you have a chat model that is used to answer frequently asked questions, caching responses can help reduce the load on the model provider, costs, and improve response times.\\nPlease see the how to cache chat model responses guide for more details.\\nRelated resources\\u200b\\n\\nHow-to guides on using chat models: how-to guides.\\nList of supported chat models: chat model integrations.\\n\\nConceptual guides\\u200b\\n\\nMessages\\nTool calling\\nMultimodality\\nStructured outputs\\nTokens\\nEdit this pagePreviousChat historyNextDocument loadersOverviewFeaturesIntegrationsInterfaceKey methodsInputs and outputsStandard parametersTool callingStructured outputsMultimodalityContext windowAdvanced topicsRate-limitingCachingRelated resourcesConceptual guidesCommunityLangChain ForumTwitterSlackGitHubOrganizationPythonJS/TSMoreHomepageBlogYouTubeCopyright ¬© 2025 LangChain, Inc.\\n\\n')]]"

      "Using Language Models‚Äã\n",
      "First up, let's learn how to use a language model by itself. LangChain supports many different language models that you can use interchangeably. For details on getting started with a specific model, refer to supported integrations.\n",
      "\n",

      "Let's first use the model directly. ChatModels are instances of LangChain Runnables, which means they expose a standard interface for interacting with them. To simply call the model, we can pass in a list of messages to the .invoke method.\n",
      "from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, SystemMessagemessages = [    SystemMessage(\"Translate the following from English into Italian\"),    HumanMessage(\"hi!\"),]model.invoke(messages)API Reference:HumanMessage | SystemMessage\n",
      "AIMessage(content='Ciao!', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 3, 'prompt_tokens': 20, 'total_tokens': 23, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_0705bf87c0', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run-32654a56-627c-40e1-a141-ad9350bbfd3e-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 20, 'output_tokens': 3, 'total_tokens': 23, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}})\n",
      "tipIf we've enabled LangSmith, we can see that this run is logged to LangSmith, and can see the LangSmith trace. The LangSmith trace reports token usage information, latency, standard model parameters (such as temperature), and other information.\n",
      "Note that ChatModels receive message objects as input and generate message objects as output. In addition to text content, message objects convey conversational roles and hold important data, such as tool calls and token usage counts.\n",
      "LangChain also supports chat model inputs via strings or OpenAI format. The following are equivalent:\n",
      "model.invoke(\"Hello\")model.invoke([{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello\"}])model.invoke([HumanMessage(\"Hello\")])\n",
      "Streaming‚Äã\n",
      "Because chat models are Runnables, they expose a standard interface that includes async and streaming modes of invocation. This allows us to stream individual tokens from a chat model:\n",
      "for token in model.stream(messages):    print(token.content, end=\"|\")\n",
      "|C|iao|!||\n",
      "You can find more details on streaming chat model outputs in this guide.\n",
      "Prompt Templates‚Äã\n",
      "Right now we are passing a list of messages directly into the language model. Where does this list of messages come from? Usually, it is constructed from a combination of user input and application logic. This application logic usually takes the raw user input and transforms it into a list of messages ready to pass to the language model. Common transformations include adding a system message or formatting a template with the user input.\n",
      "Prompt templates are a concept in LangChain designed to assist with this transformation. They take in raw user input and return data (a prompt) that is ready to pass into a language model.\n",
      "Let's create a prompt template here. It will take in two user variables:\n",
      "\n",
      "language: The language to translate text into\n",
      "text: The text to translate\n",
      "\n",
      "from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplatesystem_template = \"Translate the following from English into {language}\"prompt_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(    [(\"system\", system_template), (\"user\", \"{text}\")])API Reference:ChatPromptTemplate\n",
      "Note that ChatPromptTemplate supports multiple message roles in a single template. We format the language parameter into the system message, and the user text into a user message.\n",
      "The input to this prompt template is a dictionary. We can play around with this prompt template by itself to see what it does by itself\n",
      "prompt = prompt_template.invoke({\"language\": \"Italian\", \"text\": \"hi!\"})prompt\n",
      "ChatPromptValue(messages=[SystemMessage(content='Translate the following from English into Italian', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}), HumanMessage(content='hi!', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})])\n",
      "We can see that it returns a ChatPromptValue that consists of two messages. If we want to access the messages directly we do:\n",
      "prompt.to_messages()\n",
      "[SystemMessage(content='Translate the following from English into Italian', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}), HumanMessage(content='hi!', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={})]\n",
      "Finally, we can invoke the chat model on the formatted prompt:\n",
      "response = model.invoke(prompt)print(response.content)\n",
      "Ciao!\n",
      "tipMessage content can contain both text and content blocks with additional structure. See this guide for more information.\n",
      "If we take a look at the LangSmith trace, we can see exactly what prompt the chat model receives, along with token usage information, latency, standard model parameters (such as temperature), and other information.\n",
      "Conclusion‚Äã\n",
      "That's it! In this tutorial you've learned how to create your first simple LLM application. You've learned how to work with language models, how to create a prompt template, and how to get great observability into applications you create with LangSmith.\n",

      "Overview‚Äã\n",
      "Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced machine learning models that excel in a wide range of language-related tasks such as text generation, translation, summarization, question answering, and more, without needing task-specific fine tuning for every scenario.\n",
      "Modern LLMs are typically accessed through a chat model interface that takes a list of messages as input and returns a message as output.\n",
      "The newest generation of chat models offer additional capabilities:\n",
      "\n",
      "Tool calling: Many popular chat models offer a native tool calling API. This API allows developers to build rich applications that enable LLMs to interact with external services, APIs, and databases. Tool calling can also be used to extract structured information from unstructured data and perform various other tasks.\n",
      "Structured output: A technique to make a chat model respond in a structured format, such as JSON that matches a given schema.\n",
      "Multimodality: The ability to work with data other than text; for example, images, audio, and video.\n",
      "\n",
      "Features‚Äã\n",
      "LangChain provides a consistent interface for working with chat models from different providers while offering additional features for monitoring, debugging, and optimizing the performance of applications that use LLMs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Integrations with many chat model providers (e.g., Anthropic, OpenAI, Ollama, Microsoft Azure, Google Vertex, Amazon Bedrock, Hugging Face, Cohere, Groq). Please see chat model integrations for an up-to-date list of supported models.\n",
      "Use either LangChain's messages format or OpenAI format.\n",
      "Standard tool calling API: standard interface for binding tools to models, accessing tool call requests made by models, and sending tool results back to the model.\n",
      "Standard API for structuring outputs via the with_structured_output method.\n",
      "Provides support for async programming, efficient batching, a rich streaming API.\n",
      "Integration with LangSmith for monitoring and debugging production-grade applications based on LLMs.\n",
      "Additional features like standardized token usage, rate limiting, caching and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Integrations‚Äã\n",
      "LangChain has many chat model integrations that allow you to use a wide variety of models from different providers.\n",
      "These integrations are one of two types:\n",
      "\n",
      "Official models: These are models that are officially supported by LangChain and/or model provider. You can find these models in the langchain-<provider> packages.\n",
      "Community models: There are models that are mostly contributed and supported by the community. You can find these models in the langchain-community package.\n",
      "\n",
      "LangChain chat models are named with a convention that prefixes \"Chat\" to their class names (e.g., ChatOllama, ChatAnthropic, ChatOpenAI, etc.).\n",
      "Please review the chat model integrations for a list of supported models.\n",
      "noteModels that do not include the prefix \"Chat\" in their name or include \"LLM\" as a suffix in their name typically refer to older models that do not follow the chat model interface and instead use an interface that takes a string as input and returns a string as output.\n",
      "Interface‚Äã\n",
      "LangChain chat models implement the BaseChatModel interface. Because BaseChatModel also implements the Runnable Interface, chat models support a standard streaming interface, async programming, optimized batching, and more. Please see the Runnable Interface for more details.\n",
      "Many of the key methods of chat models operate on messages as input and return messages as output.\n",
      "Chat models offer a standard set of parameters that can be used to configure the model. These parameters are typically used to control the behavior of the model, such as the temperature of the output, the maximum number of tokens in the response, and the maximum time to wait for a response. Please see the standard parameters section for more details.\n",
      "noteIn documentation, we will often use the terms \"LLM\" and \"Chat Model\" interchangeably. This is because most modern LLMs are exposed to users via a chat model interface.However, LangChain also has implementations of older LLMs that do not follow the chat model interface and instead use an interface that takes a string as input and returns a string as output. These models are typically named without the \"Chat\" prefix (e.g., Ollama, Anthropic, OpenAI, etc.).\n",
      "These models implement the BaseLLM interface and may be named with the \"LLM\" suffix (e.g., OllamaLLM, AnthropicLLM, OpenAILLM, etc.). Generally, users should not use these models.\n",
      "Key methods‚Äã\n",
      "The key methods of a chat model are:\n",
      "\n",
      "invoke: The primary method for interacting with a chat model. It takes a list of messages as input and returns a list of messages as output.\n",
      "stream: A method that allows you to stream the output of a chat model as it is generated.\n",
      "batch: A method that allows you to batch multiple requests to a chat model together for more efficient processing.\n",
      "bind_tools: A method that allows you to bind a tool to a chat model for use in the model's execution context.\n",
      "with_structured_output: A wrapper around the invoke method for models that natively support structured output.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other important methods can be found in the BaseChatModel API Reference.\n",
      "Inputs and outputs‚Äã\n",
      "Modern LLMs are typically accessed through a chat model interface that takes messages as input and returns messages as output. Messages are typically associated with a role (e.g., \"system\", \"human\", \"assistant\") and one or more content blocks that contain text or potentially multimodal data (e.g., images, audio, video).\n",
      "LangChain supports two message formats to interact with chat models:\n",
      "\n",
      "LangChain Message Format: LangChain's own message format, which is used by default and is used internally by LangChain.\n",
      "OpenAI's Message Format: OpenAI's message format.\n",
      "\n",
      "Standard parameters‚Äã\n",
      "Many chat models have standardized parameters that can be used to configure the model:\n",
      "ParameterDescriptionmodelThe name or identifier of the specific AI model you want to use (e.g., \"gpt-3.5-turbo\" or \"gpt-4\").temperatureControls the randomness of the model's output. A higher value (e.g., 1.0) makes responses more creative, while a lower value (e.g., 0.0) makes them more deterministic and focused.timeoutThe maximum time (in seconds) to wait for a response from the model before canceling the request. Ensures the request doesn‚Äôt hang indefinitely.max_tokensLimits the total number of tokens (words and punctuation) in the response. This controls how long the output can be.stopSpecifies stop sequences that indicate when the model should stop generating tokens. For example, you might use specific strings to signal the end of a response.max_retriesThe maximum number of attempts the system will make to resend a request if it fails due to issues like network timeouts or rate limits.api_keyThe API key required for authenticating with the model provider. This is usually issued when you sign up for access to the model.base_urlThe URL of the API endpoint where requests are sent. This is typically provided by the model's provider and is necessary for directing your requests.rate_limiterAn optional BaseRateLimiter to space out requests to avoid exceeding rate limits.  See rate-limiting below for more details.\n",
      "Some important things to note:\n",
      "\n",
      "Standard parameters only apply to model providers that expose parameters with the intended functionality. For example, some providers do not expose a configuration for maximum output tokens, so max_tokens can't be supported on these.\n",
      "Standard parameters are currently only enforced on integrations that have their own integration packages (e.g. langchain-openai, langchain-anthropic, etc.), they're not enforced on models in langchain-community.\n",
      "\n",
      "Chat models also accept other parameters that are specific to that integration. To find all the parameters supported by a Chat model head to the their respective API reference for that model.\n",
      "Tool calling‚Äã\n",
      "Chat models can call tools to perform tasks such as fetching data from a database, making API requests, or running custom code. Please\n",
      "see the tool calling guide for more information.\n",
      "Structured outputs‚Äã\n",
      "Chat models can be requested to respond in a particular format (e.g., JSON or matching a particular schema). This feature is extremely\n",
      "useful for information extraction tasks. Please read more about\n",
      "the technique in the structured outputs guide.\n",
      "Multimodality‚Äã\n",
      "Large Language Models (LLMs) are not limited to processing text. They can also be used to process other types of data, such as images, audio, and video. This is known as multimodality.\n",
      "Currently, only some LLMs support multimodal inputs, and almost none support multimodal outputs. Please consult the specific model documentation for details.\n",
      "Context window‚Äã\n",
      "A chat model's context window refers to the maximum size of the input sequence the model can process at one time. While the context windows of modern LLMs are quite large, they still present a limitation that developers must keep in mind when working with chat models.\n",
      "If the input exceeds the context window, the model may not be able to process the entire input and could raise an error. In conversational applications, this is especially important because the context window determines how much information the model can \"remember\" throughout a conversation. Developers often need to manage the input within the context window to maintain a coherent dialogue without exceeding the limit. For more details on handling memory in conversations, refer to the memory.\n",
      "The size of the input is measured in tokens which are the unit of processing that the model uses.\n",
      "Advanced topics‚Äã\n",
      "Rate-limiting‚Äã\n",
      "Many chat model providers impose a limit on the number of requests that can be made in a given time period.\n",
      "If you hit a rate limit, you will typically receive a rate limit error response from the provider, and will need to wait before making more requests.\n",
      "You have a few options to deal with rate limits:\n",
      "\n",
      "Try to avoid hitting rate limits by spacing out requests: Chat models accept a rate_limiter parameter that can be provided during initialization. This parameter is used to control the rate at which requests are made to the model provider. Spacing out the requests to a given model is a particularly useful strategy when benchmarking models to evaluate their performance. Please see the how to handle rate limits for more information on how to use this feature.\n",
      "Try to recover from rate limit errors: If you receive a rate limit error, you can wait a certain amount of time before retrying the request. The amount of time to wait can be increased with each subsequent rate limit error. Chat models have a max_retries parameter that can be used to control the number of retries. See the standard parameters section for more information.\n",
      "Fallback to another chat model: If you hit a rate limit with one chat model, you can switch to another chat model that is not rate-limited.\n",
      "\n",
      "Caching‚Äã\n",
      "Chat model APIs can be slow, so a natural question is whether to cache the results of previous conversations. Theoretically, caching can help improve performance by reducing the number of requests made to the model provider. In practice, caching chat model responses is a complex problem and should be approached with caution.\n",
      "The reason is that getting a cache hit is unlikely after the first or second interaction in a conversation if relying on caching the exact inputs into the model. For example, how likely do you think that multiple conversations start with the exact same message? What about the exact same three messages?\n",
      "An alternative approach is to use semantic caching, where you cache responses based on the meaning of the input rather than the exact input itself. This can be effective in some situations, but not in others.\n",
      "A semantic cache introduces a dependency on another model on the critical path of your application (e.g., the semantic cache may rely on an embedding model to convert text to a vector representation), and it's not guaranteed to capture the meaning of the input accurately.\n",
      "However, there might be situations where caching chat model responses is beneficial. For example, if you have a chat model that is used to answer frequently asked questions, caching responses can help reduce the load on the model provider, costs, and improve response times.\n",
      "Please see the how to cache chat model responses guide for more details.\n",

Define the conditional_edges¬∂\\nWith the tool node added, now you can define the conditional_edges. \\nEdges route the control flow from one node to the next. Conditional edges start from a single node and usually contain \"if\" statements to route to different nodes depending on the current graph state. These functions receive the current graph state and return a string or list of strings indicating which node(s) to call next.\\nNext, define a router function called route_tools that checks for tool_calls in the chatbot\\'s output. Provide this function to the graph by calling add_conditional_edges, which tells the graph that whenever the chatbot node completes to check this function to see where to go next. \\nThe condition will route to tools if tool calls are present and END if not.

This limits its ability to have coherent, multi-turn conversations.\\nLangGraph solves this problem through persistent checkpointing. If you provide a checkpointer when compiling the graph and a thread_id when calling your graph, LangGraph automatically saves the state after each step. When you invoke the graph again using the same thread_id, the graph loads its saved state, allowing the chatbot to pick up where it left off. \\nWe will see later that checkpointing is much more powerful than simple chat memory - it lets you save and resume complex state at any time for error recovery, human-in-the-loop workflows, time travel interactions, and more. But first, let\\'s add checkpointing to enable multi-turn conversations.\\n\\nNote\\nThis tutorial builds on Add tools.\\n\\n1. Create a InMemorySaver checkpointer¬∂\\nCreate a InMemorySaver checkpointer:\\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver\\n\\nmemory = InMemorySaver()\\n\\nThis is in-memory checkpointer, which is convenient for the tutorial. However, in a production application, you would likely change this to use SqliteSaver or PostgresSaver and connect a database.\\n2. Compile the graph¬∂\\nCompile the graph with the provided checkpointer, which will checkpoint the State as the graph works through each node:\\ngraph = graph_builder.compile(checkpointer=memory)\\n\\nfrom IPython.display import Image, display\\n\\ntry:\\n    display(Image(graph.get_graph().draw_mermaid_png()))\\nexcept Exception:\\n    # This requires some extra dependencies and is optional\\n    pass\\n\\n3. Interact with your chatbot¬∂\\nNow you can interact with your bot!\\n\\n\\nPick a thread to use as the key for this conversation.\\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"1\"}}\\n\\n\\n\\nCall your chatbot:\\nuser_input = \"Hi there! My name is Will.\"\\n\\n# The config is the **second positional argument** to stream() or invoke()!\\nevents = graph.stream(\\n    {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_input}]},\\n    config,\\n    stream_mode=\"values\",\\n)\\nfor event in events:\\n    event[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print()\\n\\n================================ Human Message =================================\\n\\nHi there! My name is Will.\\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\\n\\nHello Will! It\\'s nice to meet you. How can I assist you today? Is there anything specific you\\'d like to know or discuss?\\n\\n\\nNote\\nThe config was provided as the second positional argument when calling our graph. It importantly is not nested within the graph inputs ({\\'messages\\': []}).\\n\\n\\n\\n4. Ask a follow up question¬∂\\nAsk a follow up question:\\nuser_input = \"Remember my name?\"\\n\\n# The config is the **second positional argument** to stream() or invoke()!\\nevents = graph.stream(\\n    {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_input}]},\\n    config,\\n    stream_mode=\"values\",\\n)\\nfor event in events:\\n    event[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print()\\n\\n================================ Human Message =================================\\n\\nRemember my name?\\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\\n\\nOf course, I remember your name, Will. I always try to pay attention to important details that users share with me. Is there anything else you\\'d like to talk about or any questions you have? I\\'m here to help with a wide range of topics or tasks.\\n\\nNotice that we aren\\'t using an external list for memory: it\\'s all handled by the checkpointer! You can inspect the full execution in this LangSmith trace to see what\\'s going on.\\nDon\\'t believe me? Try this using a different config.\\n# The only difference is we change the `thread_id` here to \"2\" instead of \"1\"\\nevents = graph.stream(\\n    {\"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": user_input}]},\\n    {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"2\"}},\\n    stream_mode=\"values\",\\n)\\nfor event in events:\\n    event[\"messages\"][-1].pretty_print()\\n\\n================================ Human Message =================================\\n\\nRemember my name?\\n================================== Ai Message ==================================\\n\\nI apologize, but I don\\'t have any previous context or memory of your name. As an AI assistant, I don\\'t retain information from past conversations. Each interaction starts fresh. Could you please tell me your name so I can address you properly in this conversation?\\n\\nNotice that the only change we\\'ve made is to modify the thread_id in the config. See this call\\'s LangSmith trace for comparison.\\n5. Inspect the state¬∂\\nBy now, we have made a few checkpoints across two different threads. But what goes into a checkpoint? To inspect a graph\\'s state for a given config at any time, call get_state(config).\\nsnapshot = graph.get_state(config)\\nsnapshot\\n\\nStateSnapshot(values={\\'messages\\': [HumanMessage(content=\\'Hi there!

This opens up exciting possibilities for more natural, contextual interactions. LangGraph\\'s checkpointing even handles arbitrarily complex graph states, which is much more expressive and powerful than simple chat memory.\\nCheck out the code snippet below to review the graph from this tutorial:\\nOpenAIAnthropicAzureGoogle GeminiAWS Bedrock\\n\\n\\npip install -U \"langchain[openai]\"\\n\\nimport os\\nfrom langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model\\n\\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"sk-...\"\\n\\nllm = init_chat_model(\"openai:gpt-4.1\")\\n\\nüëâ Read the OpenAI integration docs\\n\\n\\npip install -U \"langchain[anthropic]\"\\n\\nimport os\\nfrom langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model\\n\\nos.environ[\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"] = \"sk-...\"\\n\\nllm = init_chat_model(\"anthropic:claude-3-5-sonnet-latest\")\\n\\nüëâ Read the Anthropic integration docs\\n\\n\\npip install -U \"langchain[openai]\"\\n\\nimport os\\nfrom langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model\\n\\nos.environ[\"AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"...\"\\nos.environ[\"AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT\"] = \"...\"\\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_VERSION\"] = \"2025-03-01-preview\"\\n\\nllm = init_chat_model(\\n    \"azure_openai:gpt-4.1\",\\n    azure_deployment=os.environ[\"AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME\"],\\n)\\n\\nüëâ Read the Azure integration docs\\n\\n\\npip install -U \"langchain[google-genai]\"\\n\\nimport os\\nfrom langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model\\n\\nos.environ[\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\"] = \"...\"\\n\\nllm = init_chat_model(\"google_genai:gemini-2.0-flash\")\\n\\nüëâ Read the Google GenAI integration docs\\n\\n\\npip install -U \"langchain[aws]\"\\n\\nfrom langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model\\n\\n# Follow the steps here to configure your credentials:\\n# https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/getting-started.html\\n\\nllm = init_chat_model(\\n    \"anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620-v1:0\",\\n    model_provider=\"bedrock_converse\",\\n)\\n\\nüëâ Read the AWS Bedrock integration docs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nfrom typing import Annotated\\n\\nfrom langchain.chat_models import init_chat_model\\nfrom langchain_tavily import TavilySearch\\nfrom langchain_core.messages import BaseMessage\\nfrom typing_extensions import TypedDict\\n\\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import InMemorySaver\\nfrom langgraph.graph import StateGraph\\nfrom langgraph.graph.message import add_messages\\nfrom langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode, tools_condition\\n\\nclass State(TypedDict):\\n    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]\\n\\ngraph_builder = StateGraph(State)\\n\\ntool = TavilySearch(max_results=2)\\ntools = [tool]\\nllm_with_tools = llm.bind_tools(tools)\\n\\ndef chatbot(state: State):\\n    return {\"messages\": [llm_with_tools.invoke(state[\"messages\"])]}\\n\\ngraph_builder.add_node(\"chatbot\", chatbot)\\n\\ntool_node = ToolNode(tools=[tool])\\ngraph_builder.add_node(\"tools\", tool_node)\\n\\ngraph_builder.add_conditional_edges(\\n    \"chatbot\",\\n    tools_condition,\\n)\\ngraph_builder.add_edge(\"tools\", \"chatbot\")\\ngraph_builder.set_entry_point(\"chatbot\")\\nmemory = InMemorySaver()\\ngraph = graph_builder.compile(checkpointer=memory)\\n\\nNext steps¬∂\\nIn the next tutorial, you will add human-in-the-loop to the chatbot to handle situations where it may need guidance or verification before proceeding.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  Back to top\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                Previous\\n              \\n\\n                2.
